# Game Keylogger Educational Project

## Overview

This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the implementation of a keylogger within a game environment. It is intended to be used in controlled environments, such as isolated labs, for learning about keylogging techniques, detection, and prevention methods.

## Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational purposes and should only be used in environments where appropriate permissions have been obtained. Do not deploy or distribute any of the keylogger samples included in this project outside of the designated educational setting. Additionally, ensure that users are informed and consent to the logging of keystrokes within the game environment.

## Contents

- **Game_Keylogger**: Contains the keylogger implementation within a game executable.

# Ransomware Educational Project

## Overview

The 'ransomware' repository is dedicated to providing educational insights into the world of ransomware, a type of malicious software that encrypts files and demands ransom payments for decryption. Through this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of ransomware functionalities.

## Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational purposes and should only be used in controlled environments, such as labs, for learning about ransomware. Do not deploy or distribute any of the ransomware samples included in this project outside of the designated educational setting. Additionally, exercise caution when analyzing ransomware samples to prevent unintended damage or spread.

## Contents

- **Attacker**: This directory has the RSA Private key used for decrypting the AES-128 key sent by the victim, which was encrypted with our RSA Public key.
- **Victim**: Experience the impact of ransomware firsthand in a simulated victim environment. This directory contains the RSA public key, the 'pinball_ransomware.py' file, which you should run for testing purposes, and the background picture set by the attacker.
- **Pinball_Ransomware**: Discover the Pinball Ransomware implementation within a pinball game environment. Explore how ransomware functionalities are integrated into unexpected platforms, and learn about the challenges and opportunities presented by unconventional attack vectors.

# Reverse Shell Educational Project

## Overview

The 'reverse_shell' repository is dedicated to providing educational insights into the concept of reverse shells, a technique used in cybersecurity for establishing covert communication channels with compromised systems. Through this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of reverse shell functionalities.

## Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational purposes and should only be used in controlled environments, such as labs, for learning about reverse shells. Do not deploy or distribute any of the reverse shell samples included in this project outside of the designated educational setting. Additionally, exercise caution when analyzing reverse shell samples to prevent unintended harm or unauthorized access.

## Contents

- **Server**: Explore the tools and scripts used by attackers to initiate and maintain reverse shell connections. This directory provides insights into the techniques employed by threat actors in establishing covert communication channels with compromised systems.
- **Client**: Experience the impact of reverse shell attacks firsthand in a simulated victim environment. This directory contains resources for setting up a vulnerable system to analyze the effects of reverse shell connections and explore potential defense mechanisms.
- **Game_Reverse_Shell**: Discover the Reverse Shell implementation embedded within a game environment using multiprocessing, so the reverse shell will run even after the game is closed. Explore how reverse shell functionalities are integrated into unexpected platforms, and learn about the challenges and opportunities presented by unconventional attack vectors.
